# Ash
Welcome. This is the source code for Ash, a theme I made myself. You can see my [website](https://mathletema.github.io) and its [source code](https://github.com/mathletema/mathletema.github.io), where it is used.

I haven't packaged it yet. To use it, you will have to change the location of the \_layouts folder in config.yml.
You can see my [config.yml](https://github.com/mathletema/mathletema.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml) for reference.

To change the accent color, which is set to #4cb5ae by default, in [variables.scss](https://github.com/mathletema/ash/blob/main/_sass/_variables.scss).

Thanks for visiting!

P.S. I am currently working on making this theme independent. It currently has stylesheets for my sketches and awards site. I will be removing these sometime in the near future.
